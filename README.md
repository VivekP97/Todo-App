This is a simple todo/checklist application to demonstrate basic React features such as state, effects, and reactivity.

I tried to organize the project files in a standard way and structure the React project according to best practices in terms of separating components and maintaining clear parent/child component relationships.

## Building and running the game

To build and run the application, open a terminal/shell window in the root directory of the project and execute `npm run start`. The application will be running on `localhost:3000`.
